# GuitarNoteTabber
A web application that takes a sound input of individual guitar notes and returns the note names to the user. The front-end is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and the back-end is written using Python with the Flask web framework.

<h3>Set Up Instructions and Dependencies:</h3>

As it stands currently, the front-end and back-end are not yet connected but can be run separately. To run the back-end, simply make sure the Audioop, NumPy, MatPlotLib, and PyAudio libraries are installed, and run the Python file. Next, play individual guitar notes and the result will be returned in the console. 

To run the front-end, clone the repository and make sure Flask is installed. Next, in the terminal, navigated to the repository and run the command "python app.py". Navigate to the web address specified by the terminal and add the "/index" directory to the end. Now you can either record audio and play it back, or take the square root of a nubmer to demonstrate front-end, back-end connection.
