    The graph above shows the volume level (measured in RMS). Additionally, the
    musical note of each sample can be seen by scrolling over
    points on the graph. The sample rate is 44100HZ and each sample is the average
    of a buffer of length 4096, meaning that each data point occurs every 0.093 seconds
    or 93 milliseconds.
